y Falling Slowly (z filmu Once)


Pøedehra: [C] ,[Fmaj] ,[C] ,[Fmaj]



[C]I don't know you

[Fmaj]But I want you

[C]All the more for [Fmaj]that

[C]Words fall through me

And [Fmaj]always fool me

[C]And I can't react [Fmaj]



And [Ami]games that [G]never amount[Am]

To [G]more than they're [Ami] meant

Will [G]play themselves [Fmaj]out [Fmaj]



[C]Take this sinking [Fmaj]boat and point it home[Ami]

We've still got [Fmaj]time

[C]Raise your hopeful [Fmaj]voice you have a [Ami]choice

You've made it [Fmaj]now…..



[C]Falling slowly, [Fmaj]eyes that know me

[C]And I can't go back[Fmaj]

[C]Moods that take me [Fmaj]and erase me

[C]And I'm painted black [Fmaj]



[Ami]You have [G]suffered enough[Am]

And [G]warred with yourself [Ami]

It's [G]time that you [Fmaj]won [Fmaj]



[C]Take this sinking [Fmaj]boat and point it home[Ami]

We've still got [Fmaj]time

[C]Raise your hopeful [Fmaj]voice you have a [Ami]choice

You've made it [Fmaj]now



[C]Falling slowly [Fmaj]sing your melody [Ami]

I'll sing [F]along…. [C], [Fmaj], [Ami], [Fmaj]
