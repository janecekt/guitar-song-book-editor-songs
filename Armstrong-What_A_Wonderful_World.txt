What A Wonderful World - Louis Armstrong


I see [C]trees of [Emi]green, [F]red roses [Emi]too

[Dm7]I see them [C]bloom, [E7]for me and [Ami]you,

And I [G#]think to myself, [Dm7/G]What a [G7]wonderful wo[C]rld.[C+], [Fmaj7], [G7]



I see skies of blue and clouds of white,

The bright blessed day, the dark sacred night,

And I think to myself, what a wonderful world [C+], [F], [C]



The [G7]colors of the rainbow, so [C]pretty in the sky

Are [G7]also on the faces of [C]people goin' by

I see [Am]friends shaking [G]hands, saying, "[Am]How do you [G]do?"

[Am]They're really [C#dim7]saying, "[Dm7]I [C#dim7]love [G7]you."



I hear babies cry, I watch them grow

They'll learn much more than I'll ever know,

And I think to myself what a wonderful world [Em] [A7]



Yes I [Dm7]think to myself, [Dm7/G]what a [G7]wonderful [C]world. [C] [F] [C]
