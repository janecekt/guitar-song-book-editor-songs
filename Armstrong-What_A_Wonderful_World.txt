What A Wonderful World - Louis Armstrong


I see [C]trees of [Em]green, [F]red roses [Em]too

[Dm7]I see them [C]bloom, [E7]for me and [Am]you,

And I [G#]think to myself, [Dm7/G]What a [G7]wonderful [C]world.[C+], [Fmaj7], [G7]


I see [C]skies of [Em]blue and [F]clouds of [Em]white,

[Dm7]The bright blessed [C]day, [E7]the dark sacred [Am]night,

And I [G#]think to myself, [Dm7/G]what a [G7]wonderful [C]world [C+], [F], [C]


The [G7]colors of the rainbow, so [C]pretty in the sky

Are [G7]also on the faces of [C]people goin' by

I see [Am]friends shaking [G]hands, saying, "[Am]How do you [G]do?"

[Am]They're really [C#dim7]saying, "[Dm7]I [C#dim7]love [G7]you."


I hear [C]babies [Em]cry, [F]I watch them [Em]grow

[Dm7]They'll learn much [C]more [E7]than I'll ever [Am]know,

And I [G#]think to myself, [Dm7/G]what a [G7]wonderful [C]world [Em] [A7]

Yes I [Dm7]think to myself, [Dm7/G]what a [G7]wonderful [C]world. [C] [F] [C]
