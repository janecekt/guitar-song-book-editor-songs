Learning To Fly - Tom Petty


Well I [F]started [C]out [Am] [G]

down a [F]dirty [C]road [Am] [G]

[F] Started [C]out [Am] [G] 

[F]all [C]alone [Am] [G]


And the sun went down, as I crossed the hill

And the town lit up, the world got still

 

REF:  I'm [F]learning to [C]fly, [Am] [G]

but I [F]ain't got [C]wings [Am] [G]

[F]Coming [C]down [Am] [G]

is the [F]hardest [C]thing [Am] [G]

 

Well the good ol' days, may not return

And the rocks might melt & the sea may burn

 

REF: I'm learning to fly, but I ain't got wings

Coming down is the hardest thing


Well some say life will beat you down,
break your heart, steal your crown
So I've started out, for God knows where
I guess I'll know when I get there
 
REF:  I'm learning to fly, around the clouds,
  But what goes up must come down
  I'm learning to fly, but I ain't got wings
  Coming down is the hardest thing
