Angels - Robbie Williams


[A]I sit and wait 

Does an angel contem[D]plate my fate [F#mi], [E] 

And do they [A] know the places where we go 

when we're grey and [D]old [F#mi], [E] 

'Cause I've been [Hmi]told that sal[D]vation 

lets their [F#mi]wings unfold [F#mi],[E],[D] 

So when I'm [G]lying in my bed 

thoughts [D] running through my head 

and I [A]feel that love is dead 

[G]I'm loving [D]angels in[A]stead 


Chorus: And through it [E]all she offers me pro[F#mi]tection 

a lot of love and a[D]ffection, whether I'm right or [A]wrong 

And down the water[E]fall wherever it may [F#mi]take me 

I know that life won't [D]break me

When I come to [A]call, she won't for[Hmi]sake me[Hmi],[A],[G],[D] 

[G]I'm loving [D]angels in[A]stead


When I'm feeling weak 
and my pain walks down a one way street 
I look above and I know 
I'll always be blessed with love 
And as the feeling grows she breathes flesh 
to my bones and when love is dead
I'm loving angels instead
