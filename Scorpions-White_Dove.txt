White Dove - Scorpions


[D]A place without a[A]name

[Emi]Under a[Hmi]burning sky

[D]there's not milk[A]and honey here

[Emi]in the land of[Hmi]God


[D]Someone[A]holds a sign, it says

[Emi]we are human[Hmi]too

[D]and while the[A]sun goes down

[Emi]the world goes[Hmi]by


REF: [D]WHITE DOVE,[A]FLY WITH THE WIND

[Emi]TAKE OUR HOPE[Hmi]UNDER YOUR WINGS

[D]FOR THE WORLD TO KNOW

THAT[A]HOPE WILL NOT DIE

[Emi]WHEN THE CHILDREN[Hmi]CRY


[D]Waves big like a[A]house

[Emi]They're stranded on a[Hmi]piece of wood

[D]to leave in[A]all behind

[Emi]to start[Hmi]again


[D]but... instead of a[A]new life

[Emi]All they find is a[Hmi]door that it's closed

[D]And keep looking[A]for

[Emi]A place called[Hmi]hope


REF: WHITE DOVE...


REF: (singing "na na na")


[G]Can anyone tell me[Hmi]why

the children[Emi]of the world

have to[F]pay the price


[D]And now you're[A]telling me[Emi]

You've seen it[Hmi]all before

[D]I know that's[A]right but still[Emi]

it breaks my[Hmi]heart


[D]Well, the golden[A]lamb we've sent

[Emi]makes us feel better[Hmi]now

[D]but you know it's[Ami]just a drop[Emi]

in a sea of[Hmi]tears


Refrain: WHITE DOVE...
