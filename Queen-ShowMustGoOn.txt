Show Must Go On - Queen


Empty[Hmi] spaces, what are we living for?

Aband[G]oned places, I guess we know the score.

[Emi]On and on, does[F#mi] anybody know what we a[Emi]re looking for?

[Hmi] Another hero, another mindless crime,

Behind[G] the curtain, in the pantomime,

[Emi]Hold the line, doe[F#mi]s anybody want to t[Emi]ake it anymore?


The show mu[Hmi]st go on,

The show mu[G]st go on.

In[Emi]side my heart is breaking,

My [F#mi]make-up may be flaking,

But my [Emi]smile still [Hmi	]stays on.


Whatever [C#mi]happens, I'll leave it all to chance,

Another [A]heartache, another failed romance.

[F#mi]On and on, does[G#mi] anybody know what we [F#mi]are living for?

I guess I'm [C#mi]learning I must be warmer now,

I'll soo[A]n be turning round the corner now,

Ou[F#mi]tside the dawn is breaking, 

bu[G#mi]t inside in the dark 

I'm ac[F#mi]hing to be fr[Emi]ee.[Hmi, Emi]


The show mu[Hmi]st go on,

The show mu[G]st go on.

Ins[Emi]ide my heart is breaking,

My m[F#mi]ake-up may be flaking,

But my s[Emi]mile still s[Hmi]tays on.[G], [Emi], [F#mi], [Emi], [G]


[F]My soul [G]is painted li[Emi]ke the wings[Ami] of butterflies,

[F]Fairy-tales [G]of yesterday w[Emi]ill grow and n[Ami]ever die,

I can fl[G]y, my[Emi] friends.

The show mu[Hmi]st go on,

The show m[G]ust go on.

I'll f[Emi]ace it with a grin, 

I'm [F#mi]never giving [Emi, Hmi]in, 

on w[G]ith show.

I'll [Emi]top the bill 

I'll over[F#mi]kill 

I have to[Emi] find the will to cary on,


On with the ...	

[F#mi]On with the[Emi] show

[Hmi]The show must go on
