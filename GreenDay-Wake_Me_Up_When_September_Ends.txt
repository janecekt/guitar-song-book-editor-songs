Wake Me Up When September Ends - Green Day


Orig: Gdur


[C]Summer has [Em]come and passed

The [Am]innocent can [G]never last

[F]Wake me up [Fm]when September [C]ends



Like my father's come to pass
Seven years has gone so fast
Wake me up when September ends


®: [Am]Here comes the [Em]rain again

[F]Falling from the [C]stars

[Am]Drenched in my [Em]pain again

[F]Becoming who we [C]are



As my memory rests
But never forgets what I lost
Wake me up when September ends


Summer has come and passed
The innocent can never last
Wake me up when September ends


Ring out the bells again
Like we did when spring began
Wake me up when september ends


®: 


As my memory rests
But never forgets what I lost
Wake me up when september ends


Summer has come and passed
The innocent can never last
Wake me up when September ends


Like my father's come to pass
Twenty years has gone so fast
Wake me up when September ends


Wake me up when September ends
Wake me up when September ends
