Too Much Love Will Kill You - Queen


I'm just the [G]pieces of the [C]man I used to [G]be

Too many [Emi]bitter tears are [D]raining down on [C]me

I'm [Ami]far away from [Emi]home, and I've been [Ami]facing this [Emi]alone 

for much too [D]long



I feel like no one ever told the truth to me
About growing up and what a struggle it would be
In my tangled state of mind, I've been looking back to find
where I went wrong.


[G]Too much love will [C]kill you, if you [Emi]can't make up your [D]mind

[G]Torn between the [C]lover, and the [Emi]love you leave [D]behind

You're [G]headed for [C]disaster, 'cos you [G]never read the [Emi]signs

[G]Too much love will [C]kill you, every [G]time.



I'm just the shadow of the man I used to be
And it seems like there's no way out of this for me
I used to bring you sunshine, now all I ever do is bring you down


How would it be if you were standing in my shoes
Can't you see that it's impossible to choose
No there's no making sense of it, every way I go I have to lose.


Too much love will kill you, just as sure as none at all
It'll drain the power that's in you, make you plead and scream and crawl
And the pain will make you crazy. you're the victim of your crimes
Too much love, will kill you, every time.


Too much love will kill you, it'll make your life a lie
Yeah too much love will kill you, and you won't understand why
You'd give your life, you'd sell your soul, but here it comes again
Too much love will kill you
