Ref: Hit the road Jack

and don't you come back

no more no more 

no more no more


Hit the road Jack
and don't you come back
no more
(What do you say)


Hit the road Jack
and don't you come back
no more no more 
no more no more


Hit the road Jack
and don't you come back
no more


Well woman oh woman don't treat me so mean
You're the meanest old woman that I've ever seen


I guess if you say so
I have to pack my things and go (That's right)


Ref:


Now baby listen baby, don't you treat me this a way
Cos I'll be back on my feet someday


Don't care if you do, cos it's understood
You ain't got no money, you're just a no good


Well I guess if you say so
I have to pack my things and go


Ref:


and don't you come back no more
and don't you come back no more
