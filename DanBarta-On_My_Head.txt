On My Head (z filmu Snowborïáci) - Dan Bárta


[D]Lead my [F#m]heart in my own [G]place

Ride up to the stars across the [D]heaven

He[F#]llo, you [G]say, you will [A]drive me lazy

[D]Meeting my [F#m]heart, leaving the [G]yard

Waiting for the night’s burst, never say [D]never

[F#m]We freak,[G] we burts,pasting from our [A]angeles


® 2x: [D]When I am [F#m]standing on my [G]head

you are crazy smiling

[D]now we don’t [F#m]have it,we are [G]mad

go round this [A]speedy romance


You have the time to take a break
Get up to find your lost control
Someone lost you trust,you soul
Looking for the right size and a good measure
I am a tough guy from the sky
My good will drives me crazy


®: 4x
