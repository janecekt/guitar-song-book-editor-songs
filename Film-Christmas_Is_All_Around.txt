Christmas Is All Around


I [C]feel it in my [Dmi]fingers

[F]I feel it [G]in my toes [C] [Dmi] [F] [G]

Christ[C]mas is all a[Dmi]round me

[F]And so the [G]feeling grows [C] [Dmi] [F] [G]



It’s written in the wind
It’s everywhere I go
So if you really love Christmas
C’mon and let it snow


®: [F]You know I love Christmas, I [Dmi]always will

My [B]mind’s made up, the [C]way that I feel

There’s [F]no beginning

There’ll [Dmi]be no end

‘Cuz [D]on Christmas,

You [G]can depend [F] [Emi] [D]



You gave your presents to me
And I gave mine to you
I need Santa beside me
In everything I do

It's [C]written in the [Dmi]wind [F]

It's every[G]where I go [C] [Dmi] [F] [G]

So [C]if you really [Dmi]love me

[F]C'mon and [G]let it show [C] [Dmi]

[F]C'mon and [G]let it show [C] [Dmi] [F] [G]
