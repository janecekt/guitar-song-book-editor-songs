Don’t Cry - Guns N' Roses


[Ami]Talk to me [Dmi]softly

[G]There’s something in your [C] [Emi] [Ami]eyes

Don’t hang your head in sorrow

And please don’t cry

I know how you feel inside now

I’ve been there before

Something’s changin’ inside you

And don’t you know



®: [F]Don’t you [G]cry toni[Ami]ght

I still love you baby

Don’t you cry tonight

[F]Don’t you [G]cry tonig[C]ht

There’s a heaven above you baby

[F]And don’t [G]you cry [Ami]tonight



Give me a whisper
And give me a sign
Give me a kiss before you
Tell me good bye
Don’t you take it so hard now
And please don’t take it so bad
I’ll still be thinking of you
And the times we had... baby


®: And please remember
That I never lied
And please remember
How I felt inside now honey
You gotta make it your own way
But you’ll be alright now sugar
You’ll feel better tomorow
Come the morning light now baby


And don’t you cry tonight
An don’t you cry tonight
An don’t you cry tonight
Don’t you ever cry
Don’t you cry tonight
Baby maybe someday
Don’t you cry
Don’t you ever cry tonight
Don’t you cry
