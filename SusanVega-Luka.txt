Luka - Susan Vega


Orig: Fis dur (capo 2)


[E]My name is [H]Luka

[A]I live on the [H]second floor

[E]I live up[H]stairs from you

[A]Yes I think you've [H]seen me before

[C#mi7]If you hear [H]something late at night[C#mi7]

Some kind of [H]trouble, some kind of [A]fight

Just don't [H]ask me what it was

[A]Just don't a[H]sk me what it was

[A]Just don't a[H]sk me what it was



Maybe it's because I'm clumsy
I try not to talk too loud
Maybe it's because I'm crazy
I try not to act too proud
They only hit until you cry
And after that you don't ask why
You just don't argue anymore
You just don't argue anymore
You just don't argue anymore


Yes, I think I'm okay
Walked into the door again
If you ask that's what I'll say
And it's not your business anyway
I guess I'd like to be alone
With nothing broken, nothing thrown
Just don't ask me how I am
Just don't ask me how I am
Just don't ask me how I am


My name is Luka
I live on the second floor
I live upstairs from you
Yes I think you've seen me before
If you hear something late at night
Some kind of trouble, some kind of fight
Just don't ask me what it was
Just don't ask me what it was
Just don't ask me what it was


And they only hit until you cry
And after that you don't ask why
You just don't argue anymore
You just don't argue anymore
You just don't argue anymore
