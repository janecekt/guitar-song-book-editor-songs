Be My Baby (z filmu Høíšný Tanec)


[D]The night we [Hmi]met I knew I [Emi] needed you[A7] so.

[D] And if I [Hmi]had the chance I'd [Emi] never let you[A7] go:

[F#7] So won't you say you love me; [H] I'll make you so proud of me.

[E] We'll make them turn their heads [A]every place we[A7] go.


®: So won't you [D]please (be my be my ...)

Be my little [Hmi]baby (by one and only...)

Say you'll be my[G] darlin' (be my be my...)

Be my baby [A]now . [A7]Oh ho ho ho


I'll make you happy baby, just wait and see,
for every kiss you give me, I'll give you three.
Oh, since the day I saw you, I have been waiting for you,
You know I will adore you till eternity.
