Let It Be - Beatles


1. When I [E]find myself in [H]times of trouble

[C#mi]Mother Mary [A]comes to me

[E]speaking words of [H]wisdom let it [A]be [E]

and in my hour of [H]darkness

she is [C#mi]standing right in [A]front of me

[E]speaking words of [H]wisdom let it [A]be.[E]


®1: Let it [C#mi]be let it [H]be let it [A]be let it [E]be

whisper words of [H]wisdom let it [A]be.[E/G#, Dmi7,C]


2. And [E]when the broken [H]hearted people

[C#mi]living in the [A]world agree

[E]there will be an [H]answer let it [A]be [E]

for though they may be [H]parted

there is [C#mi]still a chance that [A]they will see

[E]there will be an [H]answer let it [A]be [E].


®2: Let it be let it be let it be let it be
there will be an answer let it be.

3. And [E]when the night is [H]cloudy

there is [C#mi]still a light that [A]shines on me

[E]shine until to[H]morrow let it [A]be [E]

I wake up to the [H]sound of music

[C#mi]Mother Mary [A]comes to me

[E]speaking words of [H]wisdom let it [A]be [E].
