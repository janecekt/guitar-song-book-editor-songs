Let It Be - Beatles


1. When I [E]find myself in [H]times of trouble

[C#mi]Mother Mary [A]comes to me

[E]speaking words of [H]wisdom let it [A]be [E]

and in my hour of [H]darkness

she is [C#mi]standing right in [A]front of me

[E]speaking words of [H]wisdom let it [A]be.[E]



®1: Let it [C#mi]be let it [H]be let it [A]be let it [E]be

whisper words of [H]wisdom let it [A]be.[E/G#, Dmi7,C]



2. And when the broken hearted people
living in the world agree
there will be an answer let it be
for though they may be parted
there is still a chance that they will see
there will be an answer let it be.


®2: Let it be let it be let it be let it be
there will be an answer let it be.

3. And when the night is cloudy
there is still a light that shines on me
shine until the morrow let it be
I wake up to the sound of music
Mother Mary comes to me
speaking words of wisdom let it be.
