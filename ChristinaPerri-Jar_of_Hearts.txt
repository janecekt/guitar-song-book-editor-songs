Jar of Hearts - Christina Perri


[Hm]I know I can't take one more [D] step towards you

[A]'Cause all thats waiting is re[Em]gret

[Hm]And don't you know I'm not your [D]ghost anymore

[A]You lost the love I loved the [G]most

[Em]I learned to  [D]live half a [A]life

[Em]And now you [D]want me one more [A]time


®: [D]Who do you think [A]you are?

Running 'round leaving [Hm]scars

Collecting a jar of [G]hearts

[Gm]Tearing love[D] apart

[D]You're gonna catch a [A]cold

From the ice inside your [Hm]soul

Don't come back for [G]me

[Gm]Who do you think you [D]are?


[Hm]I hear you're asking all [D]around

[A]If I am anywhere to be [Em]found

[Hm]But I have grown too [D]strong

[A]To ever fall back in your [G]arms

[Em]I've learned to  [D]live half a [A]life

[Em]And now you [D]want me one more [A]time


®: [D]Who do you think [A]you are? ...


Bridge: [Hm]It took so [F#]long just to [D]feel [E]alright

[Hm]Remember how to [F#]put back the [D]light in my [E]eyes

I [Hm]wish I had [F#]missed the first [D]time that we [E]kissed

'Cause [Hm]you broke [F#]all your [D]promises[E]

And [G]now you're back

You don't get to [F#]get me back


®2:  |:  [D]Who do you think you [A]are? 

Running 'round leaving [Hm]scars

Collecting a jar of [G]hearts 

and [Gm]tearing love [D]apart

[D]You're gonna catch a [A]cold

From the ice inside your [Hm]soul

So don't come back for [G]me

[Gm]Don't come back at [D]all :|

3 x [Gm]Who do you think you [D]are?
