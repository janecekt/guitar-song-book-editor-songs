Understand the things I say
Don't turn away from me
Cause I spent half my life out there
You wouldn't disagree
D'you see me, d'you see, do you like me
Do you like me standing there
Do'you notice, d'you know,
Do you see me, do you see me
Does anyone care


Unhappiness where's when I was young
And we didn't give a damn
Cause we were raised
To see life as fun and take it if we can
My mother, my mother she hold me
Did she hold me when I was out there
My father, my father he liked me
Oh he liked me, does anyone care


Understand what I've become
It wasn't my design
And people everywhere think
Something better than I am
But I miss you, I miss
Cause I liked it, I liked it
When I was out there
D'you know me, d'you know
You did not find me, you did not find
Does anyone care


Unhappiness was when I was young
And we didn't give a damn
Cause we were raised
To see life as fun and take it if we can
My mother, my mother she hold me
Did she hold me when I was out there
My father, my father he liked me
Oh he liked me, does anyone care


Does anyone care
