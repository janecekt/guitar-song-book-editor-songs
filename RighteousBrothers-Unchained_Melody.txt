Unchained Melody - Righteous Brothers


[D]Oh, my [Hmi]love, my [G]darling, I've [A]hungered for your 

[D]touch a [Hmi]long, lonely [A]time

As [D]time goes [Hm]by so [G]slowly and [A]time can do so 

[D]much are [Hmi]you still [A]mine


I [D]need your love, [A] I n[Hmi]eed your love [Fmi]

God [G]speed your love [A]to--- [D]me [D7]


[G]Lonely rivers [A]flow to the [G]sea, to the[F] sea

[G]To the open a[A]rms of the s[D]ea

L[G]onely rivers s[A]igh, wait for [G]me, wait for [F]me

[G]I'll be coming h[A]ome, wait for [D]me


Oh, my love, my darling, I hunger, hunger!, for your love,
For love. Lonely time.
And time goes by, so slowly, and time can do so much,
Are you still mine?
I need your love, I need your love.
God speed your love to me.
