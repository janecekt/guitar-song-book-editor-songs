Ironic - Alanis Morissette


Orig: Fis dur (capo 2.)


An [E]old [A]man [E]turned ninety-[F#mi]eight

He won the lottery and died the next day

It's a black fly in your chardonnay

It's a death row pardon two minutes to late

isn't it [E]ironic[A]... don't you [E]think[F#mi]



Ref: It's like ra[E] [A]in on your [E]wedding [F#mi]day

It's a free [E] [A]ride when you've [E]already [F#mi]paid

iI's the good ad[E] [A]vice that you [E]just didn't [F#mi]take

[G]And who would have [F#mi]thought... it [E]figures



Mr. play-it-safe was afraid to fly
He packed his suitcase and kissed his kids good-bye
He waited his whole damn life just to take that flight
And as the plane crashed down he thouht "well isn't this nice..."
and isn't it ironic... don't you think?


R


Well [A]life has a funny way of sneaking [E]up on you

When you think everything is okay and [F#mi]everything's Going right

And [A]life has a funny way of helping [E]you out when

you think everything's gone wrong and [F#mi]everything blows up in your face



A traffic jam when you are already late
A no-smoking sign on your cigarette break
It's like ten thousand spoons when all you need is a knife
It's like meeting the man of my dreams then meeting his Beautiful wife


and isn't it ironic... don't you think?
a little too ironic... and yeah i really do think...


R:


[A]life has a funny way of sneaking up on [E]you

[A]life has a funny, funny way [E]of helping you [A]out helping you out
