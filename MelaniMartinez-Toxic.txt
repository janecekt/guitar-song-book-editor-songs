Toxic - Melani Martinez


[Am]Baby, can't you see I'm calling 

a guy like you should wear a [C]warning

[E7]It's dangerous

[Am]I'm falling 

There's no escape I can't wait 

I need a hit Baby, give me it

You're dangerous

I'm loving it 


[Am]Too high

Can't come down

Losin' my head

Spinnin' 'round and [C]'round

[E7]Do you feel me [Am]now?


Ref:

[Am]With the taste of your lips

I'm [C]on a ride

[Dm]You're toxic [E7]I'm slippin' under

[Am]With a taste of the poison [C]paradise

[Dm]I'm addicted to you

[E7]Don't you know that you're toxic? [Am] [C]

And I [Dm]love what you do

Don't you [E7]know that you're toxic? [Am] [C]


It's getting late, to give you up
I took a sip, from my devil's cup
Slowly, 
it's taking over me


[Am]Too high, can't come down

Loosing my head, spinning round and [C]round

[E7] Can you feel me [Am]now?


Ref

[Am]Intoxicate me [C]now, with your lovin' now

[Dm]I think I'm ready now, [E7] I think I'm ready now

[Am]Intoxicate me [C]now, with your lovin' now

[Dm]I think I'm ready now, [E7] I think I'm ready now

[Am]Intoxicate me [C]now, with your lovin' now

[Dm]I think I'm ready now, [E7] I think I'm ready now

[Am]Intoxicate me [C]now, with your lovin' now

[Dm]I think I'm ready now, [E7] I think I'm ready now

Intoxicate me now
