Everything I do  - Bryan Adams


[D]Look into my eyes, [A]you will see [G]what you mean to[A]me 

Search your [D]heart, search your [A]soul and when you [G]find me there 

you’ll [D]search no [A]more 



®: Don’t [Em]tell me it’s not worth [D]trying [Em]for 

[D]You can’t [Em]tell me it’s not worth [D]dying [Em]for 

You know it’s [D]true, everything I [A]do, I do it [D]for you 



Look into your heart, you will find, there’s nothing there to hide 
Take me as I am, take my life, I would give it all, 
I would sacrifice 


®: Don’t [Em]tell me it’s not worth [D]fighting [Em]for 

[D]I can’t [Em]help it, there’s nothing [D]I want [Em]more 

You know it’s [D]true, everything I [A]do, I do it [D]for you 



There’s [C]no love like [F]your love, and no [C]other 

could give [G]more love 

There’s no [D]where unless [A]you’re there, all the [E]time,  

all the [A]way 



solo: [G],[D],[G],[D]



®: Oh you can’t tell me it’s not worth trying for 

I can’t help it, there’s nothing I want more 

Yeah I would [D]fight for you, I’d [A]lie for you, walk the [G]wire for you, Yeah I’d [Gm]die for you 



You know it’s [D]true, everything I [A]do, oh[G], I do it [D]for you
