Where Did You Sleep - Nirvana


1. [E]My girl, my girl, don't [A]lie to [G]me

Tell me [H]where did you [H/F#]sleep last [E]night

[E]In the pines, in the pines, where the [A]sun don't ever [G]shine

I would [H]shiver the [H/F#]whole night [E]through



2. My girl, my girl, where will you go
I'm going where the cold wind blows
In the pines, in the pines, where the sun don't ever shine
I would shiver the whole night through


3. Her husband, was a hard working man
Just about a mile from here
His head was found in a driving wheel
But his body never was found


1. 


2.


My girl, my girl, where will you go
I'm going where the cold wind blows
In the pines, the pines
The sun, the shine
I'll shiver the whole night through
