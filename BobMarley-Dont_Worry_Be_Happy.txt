Don't Worry Be Happy - Bob Marley


Intro: [C] [Dm] [F] [C]



[C]Here's a little song I wrote

[Dmi]You might want to sing it note for note

Don't [F]worry be [C]happy

Every life we have some trouble

When you worry you make it double

Don't worry be happy



Don't [F]worry be [C]happy now



Ref: 2x  [C] Ta ta ta ta ta ta ta ta ta [Dm]ta ta ta  (don't worry)

Ta ta ta ta [F] ta ta ta (be happy)

Ta ta ta [C] ta (don't worry be happy)



Ain't got no place to lay your head
Somebody came and took your bed
Don't worry be happy


The landlord say your rent is late
He may have to litigate
Don't worry be happy ( Look at me I'm happy )


Ref:


Ain't got no cash ain't got no style
Aint' got no gal to make you smile
Don't worry be happy


Cos when you're worried your face will frown
And that will bring everybody down
So don't worry be happy (Don't worry be happy now)


Ref: (opakovat do zblbnutí)
