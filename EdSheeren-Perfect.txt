Perfect - Ed Sheeren


I found a [C]love for [Am]me

Darling, just [F]dive right in and follow my [G]lead

Well, I found a [C]girl, beauti[Ami]ful and sweet

Oh, I never[F] knew you were the someone waiting for [G]me


'Cause we were just kids when we [C]fell in love

Not knowing [Am]what it was

I will not [F]give you up this [C]ti[G]me

But darling, just [C]kiss me slow

Your heart is [Am]all I own

And in your [F]eyes you're holding [G]mine


® Ba[Am]by, I'm [F]dancing in the [C]dark

With [G]you between my [Ami]arms

[F]Barefoot on the [C]grass

[G]Listening to our [Am]favourite song

When you [F]said you looked a [C]mess

I whispered [G]underneath my [Am]breath

(but) you [F]heard it,

Darling, [C]you look [G]perfect to[C]night [C] [G/B] [Am] [G] [F] [G]


Well, I found a [C]woman, stronger than [Am]anyone I know

She shares my [F]dreams, I hope that someday I'll share her [G]home

I found a [C]love to carry [Am]more than just my secrets

To carry [F]love, to carry children of our [G]own


We are still kids but we're [C]so in love, 

Fighting a[Am]gainst all odds

I know we'll [F]be alright this [G]time, 

Darling, just [C]hold my hand

Be my girl, [Am]I'll be your man

I see my [F]future in your [G]eyes


® Ba[Am]by, I'm [F]dancing in the [C]dark

With [G]you between my [Am]arms

[F]Barefoot on the [C]grass

[G]Listening to our [Am]favourite song

I have [F]faith in what I [C]see

Now I know [G]I have met an [Am]angel 

In [F]person and [C]she looks [G]perfect

No I [Am]don't [F]deserve this,[C]You look [G]perfect to[C]night [G/B] [Am] [G] [F] [G]
