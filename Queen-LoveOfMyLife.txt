Love Of My Life - Queen


[D]Love of my life - you've [Hm]hurt me,

You've [Em]broken my heart and [A]now you leave me.

[D]Love of my [D7]life can't you [G]see?

Bring it [Em]back, bring it [Hm]back,

Don't [C]take it a[G]way from me, be[C]cause [G]you [Em]don't [A]know, [D]what it means to [G]me.


[D]Love of my life don't [Hm]leave me,

You've [Em]taken my love, and [A]now desert me,

[D]Love of my [D7]life can't you [G]see,

Bring it [Em]back, bring it [Hm]back,

Don't [C]take it a[G]way from me, be[C]cause [G]you [Em]don't [A]know, [D]what it means to [G]me.


[Em]You will remember - When [Hm]this is blown over

And [C]everything's all by the [G]way[H7]

[Em]When I grow older [Hm]I will be there at your[Fdim] side to [G#dim]remind you

how [Am]I still love you - [D]still love you.


[Em]Hurry back - hurry [Hm]back,

Don't [C]take it a[G]way from me, be[C]cause [G]you [Em]don't [A]know - [D]what it means [G]to me -

[Em]Love of my life

[Hm]Love of my life...
