Someone Like You - Adele


[A]I heard that you're [E]settled down

That you [F#m]found a girl

And you're [D]married now


[A]I heard that your [E]dreams came true

Guess she [F#m]gave you things 

I didn't [D] give to you


[A]Old friend why are [E]you so shy

It ain't [F#m]like you to hold back 

Or [D]hide from life


Bridge: [E]I hate to turn up out of the [F#mi]blue uninvited but 

I [D]couldn't stay away I couldn't fight it

I'd [E]hoped you'd see my face

And [F#m]you'd be reminded that for [D]me it isn't [E]over


Chorus: [A]Never mind, I'll [E]find someone like [F#m]you[D]

I wish [A]nothing but the [E]best for [F#m]you [D]too

Don't [A]forget me I [E]beg I re-[F#m]member you [D]said

Sometimes it [A]lasts in love but [E]sometimes it hurts in-[F#m]stead[D]

Sometimes it [A]lasts in love but [E]sometimes it hurts in-[F#m]stead, [D]yeah


[A]You'd know how [E]time flies

Only [F#m]yesterday 

was the [D]time of our lives


We were [A]born and raised in a [E]summer haze

Bound by [F#m]the surprise

of our[D]glory days


Bridge: 


Chorus: 


[E]Nothing compares no worries or cares

[F#mi]Regrets and mistakes their memories make

[D] Who would have known how 

Bitter-[Bmi]sweet [C#mi]this would [D]taste


Chorus: 


Chorus: ... ... ...

3x Sometimes it [A]lasts in love but [E]sometimes it hurts in-[F#mi]stead[D]
