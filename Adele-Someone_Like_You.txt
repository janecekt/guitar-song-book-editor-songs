Someone Like You - Adele


[A]I heard that you're [E]settled down

That you [F#mi]found a girl

And you're [D]married now



[A]I heard that your [E]dreams came true

Guess she [F#mi]gave you things 

I didn't [D] give to you



[A]Old friend why are [E]you so shy

It ain't [F#mi]like you to hold back 

Or [D]hide from life



Bridge: [E]I hate to turn up out of the [F#mi]blue uninvited but 

I [D]couldn't stay away I couldn't fight it

I'd [E]hoped you'd see my face

And [F#mi]you'd be reminded that for [D]me it isn't [Dmaj7]over [D]



Chorus: [A]Never mind, I'll [E]find someone like [F#mi]you[D]

I wish [A]nothing but the [E]best for [F#mi]you [D]too

Don't [A]forget me I [E]beg I re-[F#mi]member you [D]said

Sometimes it [A]lasts in love but [E]sometimes it hurts in-[F#mi]stead[D]

Sometimes it [A]lasts in love but [E]sometimes it hurts in-[F#mi]stead, [D]yeah



Verse: You'd know how time flies
Only yesterday 
was the time of our lives
We were born and raised
In a summer haze
Bound by the surprise of our glory days


Bridge: [E]I hate to turn up out of the [F#mi]blue uninvited [D]but 

I couldn't stay away I couldn't fight it

I'd [E]hoped you'd see my face

And [F#mi]that you'd be reminded that for [D]me it isn't [Dmaj&]over [D]



Chorus: [A]Never mind, I'll [E]find someone like [F#mi]you[D]

I wish [A]nothing but the [E]best for [F#mi]you [D]too

Don't [A]forget me I [E]beg I re-[F#mi]member you [D]said

Sometimes it [A]lasts in love but [E]sometimes it hurts in-[F#mi]stead[D]

Sometimes it [A]lasts in love but [E]sometimes it hurts in-[F#mi]stead, [D]yeah



[E]Nothing compares no worries or cares

[F#mi]Regrets and mistakes their memories make

[D] Who would have known how 

Bitter-[Bmi]sweet [C#mi]this would [D]taste



Chorus: Never mind I’ll find someone like you
I wish nothing but the best for you too
Don't forget me I beg I re-member you said
Sometimes it lasts in love but sometimes it hurts in-stead


Chorus 4: [A]Never mind, I'll [E]find someone like [F#mi]you[D]

I wish [A]nothing but the [E]best for [F#mi]you [D]too

Don't [A]forget me I [E]beg I re-[F#mi]member you [D]said

Sometimes it [A]lasts in love but [E]sometimes it hurts in-[F#mi]stead[D]

Sometimes it [A]lasts in love but [E]sometimes it hurts in-[F#mi]stead[D]

Sometimes it [A]lasts in love but [E]sometimes it hurts in-[F#mi]stead[D]
