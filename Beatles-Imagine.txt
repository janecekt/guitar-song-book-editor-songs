[G]It´s easy [C]if you try,

[G]No hell below [C]us

[G]Above us only[C] sky

[C]Imagine[Em] all the [Am] peolpe

[D]Living for today [D7] A-ha



Imagine thare´s no countries,
it isn´t hard to do,
nothing to kill or die for,
and no religion too.
Imagine all the people,
living life in peace Yu - huh


®: [C]You may [D]say that I´m a [G]dreamer

[C]But I´m [D]not the only [G]one

[C]I hope some [D]day you will [G]join us [C#]

[C]And the [D]world will be as [G]one.



Imagine no possesions,
I wonder if you can,
no need for greed or hunger, a brother hood of man.
Imagine all the people,
sharing all the world Yu - huh


®: You may say that I´m a dreamer...
