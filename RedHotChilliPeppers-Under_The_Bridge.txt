Under The Bridge - Red Hot Chilli Peppers


intro: [C] [E]



[D]Sometimes I [A]feel like I [Hmi]don't have a

[F#mi]part[G]ner

[D]Sometimes I [A]feel like [Hmi]my only [G]friend

is the City I live in the city of angels

Lonely as I am together we cry



I drive on her streets 'cause she's my companion
I walk through her hills 'cause she knows who I am
She sees my good deeds and she kisses me windy
I never worry now that is a lie


Ref:[Emi]I don't ever want to [D]feel

[A]Like I [Emi]did that day

Take me to the place I love

Take me all the way

I don't ever want to feel

Like I did that day

Take me to the place I love

Take me all the way yea yea yea



It's hard to believe that there's nobody out there
It's hard to believe that I'm all alone
At least I have her love the city she loves me
Lonely as I am together we cry


Ref:


[B]Yea [F6]yea [Esmaj7]yea

[G]Oh [B]no no no [F6]yea [Esmaj7]yea

Love me I say yea yea

(spoken) [Es]One [D]time



[G]Under the bridge down-[B]town

[F6]Is where I [Esmaj7]drew some blood

Under the bridge down-town

I could not get enough

Under the bridge down-town

Forgot about my love

Under the bridge down-town

I gave my life away...
