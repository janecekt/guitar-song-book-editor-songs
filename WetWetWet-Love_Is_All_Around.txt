Love Is All Around (Wet Wet Wet)


I [C]feel it in my [Dmi]fingers

[F]I feel it [G]in my to[C]es[Dmi] [F] [G]

When [C]love is all a[Dmi]round me

[F]And so the [G]feeling g[C]rows[Dmi] [F] [G]


It’s written on the wind
It’s everywhere I go ... oh, yes it is
So, if you really love me
Come on and let it show


REF: [F]You know I love you

I [Dmi]always will

My [F]mind’s made up

By the [C]way that I feel

There’s [F]no beginning

There’ll [Dmi]be no end

‘Cos [Dmi]on my love

You [G]can depend


I [C]see your face be[Dmi]fore me

[F]As I lay [G]on my [C]bed[Dmi][F][G]

I [C]kinda get to [Dmi]thinking

[F]Of all the [G]things you [C]said [Dmi][F][G]


You [C]give your promise [Dmi]to me

[F]And I give [G]mine to [C]you [Dmi][F][G]

I [C]need someone [Dmi]beside me

[F]In every[G]thing I [C]do [Dmi][F][G]
