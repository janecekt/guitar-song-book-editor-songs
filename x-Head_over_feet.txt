x Head over feet - Alanis Morissette


[C]I [G]had no [Ami]choice but to [F]hear you

You stated your case time and again

I thought about it



You treat me like I'm a princess
I'm not used to liking that
You ask how my day was


Ref: [D]You've already won me [Hmi]over

[G]in spite of [A]me

Don't be alarmed if I fall

head over feet

Don't be surprised if I love you

for all that you are

[F]I couldn't [C]help it

[G]It's all your fault



Your love is thick and it swallowed me whole
You're so much braver than I gave you credit for
That's not lip service


Ref: 


You are the bearer of unconditional things
You held your breath and the door for me
Thanks for your patience


harmonica solo


You're the best listened that I've ever met
You're my best friend
Best friend with benefits
What took me so long


I've never felt this healthy before
I've never wanted something rational
I am aware now
I am aware now


Ref:
