I'm a Believer (z filmu Shrek)


[D]I thought love was [A]only true in [D]fairy tales
[D]Meant for someone [A]else but not for [D]me.
[G]Love was out to [D]get me
[G]That's the way it [D]seemed.
[G]Disappointment [D]haunted all my [A]dreams.


Chorus:
Then I saw her [D]face [G]
Now I'm a be[D]liever [G]
Not a [D]trace [G]
Of doubt in my [D]mind [G]
I'm in [D]love, [G]
I'm a be[D]liever!
I couldn't [F]leave her
If I [A]tried.


[D]I thought love was [A]more or less a [D]given thing,
[D]Seems the more I [A]gave the less I [D]got
[G]What's the use in [D]trying?
[G]All you get is [D]pain.
[G]When I needed [D]sunshine I got [A]rain.
