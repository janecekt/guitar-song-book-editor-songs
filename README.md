# What is this? #
  * Repository of songs for my personal songbook
  * It is meant to be used in conjunction with the project [https://gitlab.com/janecekt/guitar-song-book-editor](https://gitlab.com/janecekt/guitar-song-book-editor) 
  * Feel free to copy the repository to create your own songbook with your own songs


# Creating your own songbook #
  * Most likely you will want to create your own songbook instead of modifying mine
  * To do this please follow these steps
      * Copy the content of this repository [guitar-song-book-editor-songs](https://gitlab.com/janecekt/guitar-song-book-editor-songs)
      * Replace my songs with your songs
      * Push the changes into your own gitlab repository where you'll manage your songbook
      * Gitlab will automatically build a pdf and pwa-songbook for you and put them into packages
         * NOTE: Take a look at the .gitlab-ci.yaml and tweak it as necessary


# Contributions #
  * The repository is maintained on GitLab [https://gitlab.com/janecekt/guitar-song-book-editor-songs](https://gitlab.com/janecekt/guitar-song-book-editor-songs) 
  * It is mirrored to GitHub as a read-only copy but it is not maintained there any more
  * Keep in mind that this is my personal songbook. You are welcome to submit a merge request to correct a mistake. If you intend to create your own personal songbook it makes more sense to create your own repo as per the above.
