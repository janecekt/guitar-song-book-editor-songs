x Under The Bridge - Red Hot Chilli Peppers


intro: [D] [F#]



[E]Sometimes I [H]feel like I [C#mi]don't have a

[G#mi]part[A]ner

[E]Sometimes I [H]feel like [C#mi]my only [A]friend

is the City I live in the city of angels

Lonely as I am together we cry



I drive on her streets 'cause she's my companion
I walk through her hills 'cause she knows who I am
She sees my good deeds and she kisses me windy
I never worry now that is a lie


Ref:[F#mi]I don't ever want to [E]feel

[H]Like I [F#mi]did that day

Take me to the place I love

Take me all the way

I don't ever want to feel

Like I did that day

Take me to the place I love

Take me all the way yea yea yea



It's hard to believe that there's nobody out there
It's hard to believe that I'm all alone
At least I have her love the city she loves me
Lonely as I am together we cry


Ref:


[C]Yea [G6]yea [Fmaj7]yea

[A]Oh [C]no no no [G6]yea [Fmaj7]yea

Love me I say yea yea

(spoken) [F]One [E]time



[A]Under the bridge down-[C]town

[G6]Is where I [Fmaj7]drew some blood

Under the bridge down-town

I could not get enough

Under the bridge down-town

Forgot about my love

Under the bridge down-town

I gave my life away...
