Intro: [C, D, E, C, D, Emi]


I m[E]et her in a club down in old Soho where you

[A]drink champagne and it [D]tastes just like cherry [E]cola - C-O-L-A

[A]co[G#us4]la

She [E]walked up to me and she asked me to dance I [A]asked her her name and

in a [D]dark brown voice she said

[E]Lola L-O-L-A [A]Lola [D] Lo lo lo lo [C]Lo - la [D, E]


Well I'm not the world's most physical guy, but when she squezzed me tight she
nearly broke my spine.
You know my Lola Lo Lo Lo Lo Lola - Well I'm not dumb but I can't understand
why she walked like a woman, but talked like a man.
I know my Lola, Lo Lo Lo Lo Lola, Lo Lo Lo Lo Lola


Well we dr[H7]ank champagne and danced all night, [F#7]under electric candle

light

She [A]picked me up and sat me on her knee and, [A] said "pretty boy won't you

[H]come home with me?"


Well, I'm not the world's most passionate guy, but when I looked in her eyes,
well I almost fell for my
Lola Lo lo lo lo Lo - la Lo lo lo lo Lo - la, Lola Lo lo lo lo Lo - la
Lo lo lo lo Lo - la


I [A]pushed [E]her a[H]way I [A]walked [E]to the [H]door I [A]fell [E]to the

[H]floor

I got [E]down [G#7]on my [C#mi]knees Then [H]I looked at her and she at [H13]me

[E]


Well, that's the way that I want it to stay...
I always want it to be that way for my Lola Lo Lo Lo Lo Lola
Girls will be boys and boys will be girls, It's a mixed up muddled up shook up
world,
Except my Lola Lo Lo Lo Lo Lola


Hey and I'd [H7]left home just a week before, and I'd [F#7]never ever kissed a

woman before

Well [A]Lola smiled and took me by the hand, [A] said pretty boy, gonna

[H]make you a man.


Well I'm not the world's most passionate man, But I know what I am and I'm
glad I'm a man and so is Lola.
