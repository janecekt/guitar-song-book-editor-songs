Leaving on a Jet Plane (z filmu Armagedon) - John Denver


[H7]All my [E]bags are packed I’m [A]ready to go,

I am [E]standing here out[A]side the door,

I [E]hate to wake you [A]up to say good-[H]bye.


But the [E]dawn is breaking, it’s [A]early morn’

The [E]Taxi’s waiting, he’s [A]blowing his horn,

Al[E]ready I’m so [A]lonesome I could [H]die.


®: So [E]kiss me and [A]smile for me,

[E]Tell me that you’ll [A]wait for me,

[E]Hold me like you [F#mi]never let me [H]go,

’Cause I’m [E]leaving [A]on a jet plane,

[E]Don’t know when [A]I’ll be back again.

[E]Oh babe [A]I hate you [H]go.


There’s so many times I’ve let you down
So many times I’ve played around,
I tell you now they don’t mean a thing.


Every place I’ll go I’ll think of you
Every song I’ll sing I’ll sing for you
When I’ll come back I’ll bring you wedding ring.


®: So kiss me...


Now the time has come to leave you
One more time let me kiss you
Then close your eyes I’ll be on my way.


Dream about the days to come
When I won’t have to leave alone
About the times I don’t have to say.


®: So kiss me...
