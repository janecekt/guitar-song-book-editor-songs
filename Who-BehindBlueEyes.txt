Behind Blue Eyes - Who


No [Hm]one knows what it's [D]like

To be the [A]bad man

To be the [G]sad man

Be[E]hind blue eyes 


No one knows what it's like
To be hated
To be fated
To telling only lies 


REF: But my dr[G]eams[A]

They aren't as e[D]mpty

As my con[G]science s[A]eems to [Hm]be 

I have hou[F]rs, only lo[G]nely

My love is ven[A]geance

That's never [E]free 


No one knows what it's like
To feel these feelings
Like I do
And I blame you 


No one bites back as hard
On their anger
None of my pain and woe
Can show through 


REF: 


No one knows what it´s like
To be mistreated 
To be defeated
Behind blue eyes


No one knows how to say
That they´re sorry
don´t worry
Im not tell them lies 


REF: 


No one knows what it's like
To be the bad man
To be the sad man
Behind blue eyes...
