Happy Christmas - John Lennon


1. So this is [A]Christmas, 

and what have you [Hmi]done

Another year [E]over, 

and a new one just [A]begun

And so this is [D]Christmas,

I hope you have [Emi]fun

The near and the [A]dear ones

the old and the [D]young

A very merry [G]Christmas, 

and a happy New [A]Year

Let's hope it's a [Emi]good one [G]

without any [D]fear [E]



2. And so this is [A]Christmas, 

for weak and for [Hmi]strong

For rich and the [E]poor ones, 

the world is so [A]large

And so happy [D]Christmas, 

for black and for [Em]white

For yellow and [A]red ones, 

let's stop all the [D]fight

A very merry [G]Christmas, 

and a happy New [A]Year

Let's hope it's a [Emi]good one, 

[G]Without any [D]fear [E]



1. (misto "I" je všude "WE")


[A]War is over

[Hmi]If you want it

[E]War is over

[A]Now...
