Stand By Me - Ben E King


[A, F#mi, D, E, A]



1.When the [A]night has come, and the [F#mi]land is dark

And the [D]moon is the [E]only light we will [A]see

No, I [A]won't be afraid, oh, [F#mi]I won't be afraid

Just as [D]long as you [E]stand, stand by [A]me



®: So [A]darlin', darlin' stand by me

Oh [F#mi]stand by me

Oh [D]stand, stand [E]by, stand by [A]me



2. If the sky that we look upon should tumble and fall
Or the mountains should crumble to the sea
I won't cry, I won't cry, no, I won't shed a tear
Just as long as you stand, stand by me


®: And darlin', darlin' stand by me
Oh stand by me
Whoa stand now, stand by, stand by me


®: And darlin', darlin' stand by me
Oh stand by me
Oh stand, stand by, stand by me


3.=2.


®: And darlin', darlin' stand by me
Oh stand by me
Whoa stand now, stand by, stand by me


®: So darlin', darlin' stand by me
Oh stand by me
Oh stand now, stand by, stand by me


®: Whenever you're in trouble just stand by me
Oh stand by me
Whoa stand now, oh stand, stand by me...
