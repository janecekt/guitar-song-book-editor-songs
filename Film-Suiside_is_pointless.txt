Suicide Is Painless (z filmu MASH)


[Dmi]Through early morning [G]fog I see

[C]visions of the [Ami]things to be

[Dmi]the pains that are with[G]held for me

[C]I realize and [Ami]I can see...[A]



REF.: [Dmi]that suicide is [G]painless

[C]It brings on many [Ami]changes

[F]and I can take or [G]leave it if I [Ami]please.



I try to find a way to make
all our little joys relate
without that ever-present hate
but now I know that it's too late, and...


REF.


The game of life is hard to play
I'm gonna lose it anyway
The losing card I'll someday lay
so this is all I have to say.


REF.


The only way to win is cheat
And lay it down before I'm beat
and to another give my seat
for that's the only painless feat.


REF.


The sword of time will pierce our skins
It doesn't hurt when it begins
But as it works its way on in
The pain grows stronger...watch it grin, but...


REF.


A brave man once requested me
to answer questions that are key
is it to be or not to be
and I replied 'oh why ask me?'


REF.: [Dmi]'Cause suicide is [G]painless

[C]it brings on many [Ami]changes

[F]and I can take or [G]leave it if I [Ami]please.

...[F]and you can do the [G]same thing if you [Ami]please.
