Total Eclipse Of The Heart - Bonnie Tayler


[Ami]Turnaround, Every now and then I get a [G]little bit lonely and you're never coming round 

[Ami]Turnaround, Every now and then I get a [G]little bit tired of listening to the sound of my tears

[C]Turnaround, Every now and then I get a [B]little bit nervous that the best of all the years have gone by

[C]Turnaround, Every now and then I get a [B]little bit terrified and then I see the look in your eyes


[Es]Turnaround [G#maj7]bright [G#]eyes, every now and then I fall apart

[Es]Turnaround [G#maj7]bright [G#]eyes, every now and then I fall apart


[Ami]Turnaround, Every now and then I get a [G]little bit restless and I dream of something wild 

[Ami]Turnaround, Every now and then I get a [G]little bit helpless and I'm lying like a child in your arms


[C]Turnaround, Every now and then I get a [B]little bit angry and I know I've got to get out and cry

[C]Turnaround, Every now and then I get a [B]little bit terrified but then I see the look in your eyes


[Es]Turnaround [G#maj7]bright [G#]eyes, every now and then I fall apart

[Es]Turnaround [G#maj7]bright [G#]eyes, every now and then I fall [G]apart


And I [Emi]need you now [C]tonight

And I [D]need you more than [G]ever

And if you'll [Emi]only hold me [C]tight

We'll be [D]holding on for[G]ever

And we'll [Emi]only be making it [C]right

Cause we'll [D]never be wrong 


To[Emi]gether we can take it to the [D]end of the line 

Your [Emi]love is like a shadow on me [A]all of the time

I [G]don't know what to do and I'm [D]always in the dark

We're [Emi]living in a powder keg and [A]giving off sparks


I really need you to[G]night 

For[D]ever's gonna ([Hmi])start to[C]night

(For[D]ever's gonna start [C6]tonight)


[G]Once upon a time I was [Emi7]falling in love

But [Hmi]now I'm only falling a[C]part

[C] [G] There's [Ami]nothing I can do 

A [D]total eclipse of the [G]heart [Emi] [C] [D]


[G]Once upon a time there was [Emi]light in my life

But [Hmi] now there's only love in the [C]dark

[C] [G] [Ami]Nothing I can say

A [D]total eclipse of the [G]heart [Emi] [C] [D] [G]
