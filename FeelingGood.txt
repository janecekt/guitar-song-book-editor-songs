Feeling Good


[Am] [Am/G] [F] [E]

Birds flying high you know how I feel

Sun in the sky you know how I feel

Breeze driftin' on by you know how I feel

Ref: It's a [Am]new dawn

It's a [Am/G]new day

It's a [F]new life

[E]For [F]me

[E]And I'm feeling [Am]good [Am/G], [F] [E]


Fish in the sea you know how I feel
River running free you know how I feel
Blossom on the tree you know how I feel


Ref:


Dragonfly out in the sun you know what I mean, don't you know
Butterflies all havin' fun you know what I mean
Sleep in peace when day is done
That's what I mean


Ref: And this [Am]old world 

is a [Am/G]new world

And a [Fm]bold world

[E]For [Fm]me

[E]And I'm feeling [Am]good [Am/G], [Fm] [E]


Stars when you shine you know how I feel
Scent of the pine you know how I feel
Oh freedom is mine
And I know how I feel
